# Faster R-CNN with Inception v2 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.04381.pdf) pre-trained on the COCO dataset

### What is it?
* This application allows you automatically to annotate many various objects on images.
* It uses [Faster RCNN Inception Resnet v2 Atrous Coco Model](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/faster_rcnn_inception_resnet_v2_atrous_coco_2018_01_28.tar.gz) from [tensorflow detection model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md)
* It can work on CPU (with Tensorflow or OpenVINO) or GPU (with Tensorflow GPU).
